# Pi Hole Remote
Just a simple mobile app for enabling and disabling adblocking on my [Pi Hole](https://pi-hole.net/). The app is written in [Svelte Native](https://svelte-native.technology/). A framework that combines [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Nativescript](https://www.nativescript.org/). Originally created using the [Svelte Native Template](https://github.com/halfnelson/svelte-native-template).
